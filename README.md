# Modal Window 

## Introduction

In your web foundation class you have been taught how DOM manipulation, you'll practice with lots of the concepts you've seen: 

This project has a starter file that contains the HTMl, CSS and JS for the task. It requires more time to explore the code, trace the behaviors, and understand how things tie together.

## Starter code

Let's quickly walk through the starter code files and their descriptions:

- `index.html` contains the html for the project. In it you will see a button element with `show modal` class, a div container for the `modal` and a div container responisble for the `overlay`.
- `style.css` contains the styles for the html file. Go through each class to know what they do 

# Your Task

## Part 1
You applied to get an intership in a tech company and you are given a task to prove you know how to manipulate the DOM. Your task is to add functionalities on some buttons. When the user clicks on the `show modal` button a modal and overlay is expected to show. The modal and overlay is written and styled for you already. You are only required to make it visible. Follow the steps below to achieve this 
- Study the HTMl and CSS in the starter file to know how the code works
- Identify the `show modal` button, `overlay` and the `modal` container
- Select each on of them in the script file and save them in a variable
- Add a function to the `show modal` button such that when it is clicked it removes the `hidden` class from the `modal` and `overlay` container


## Part 2
After you have made it visible, the user should be able to leave the modal window. To make this possible follow the steps below
- Identify the button with the `close-modal` class in the modal container
- Select it in the script file and save it in a variable
- Add a function to the `close-modal` class and the `overlay` container such that when any on of them is clicked the `hidden` class you removed in part one is added back to the `modal` and `overlay` container
